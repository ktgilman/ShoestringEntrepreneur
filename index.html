			<p>As a Business Owner, you are always trying to grow your business in some way.  You can define that growth any way you want to: growing revenues, profits, ease of doing business, etc.  However you choose to see your company grow, The Shoestring Entrepreneur is here to ensure that it happens. We are a company dedicated to building small businesses from the ground up. Not only will we give your business the attention and dedication we give our own, we will also provide you with the experience, processes, and services that will take your company to the next level.</p>
			<p>What kinds of companies do we work with? We can help practically everyone, from individuals to established businesses. If your goal is improvement, we can help! Here are some of the many situations we are excited to work with:</p>
			<div class="dropdown">
			    <ul id="bustypes" class="secondlevel">
				<li>
				    <button>Startup</button>
				    <p>If you have recently started your company or are planning on starting soon, your primary goal is survival. Whether you have already begun experiencing success or are struggling to get your business off the ground, we can help. Our goal is not only to help you survive but to thrive in your new business. We want you to be as excited every day as you were the first time you decided to start out on your own. The ups and downs of owning a business can sap your energy. We'll get it back for you, and together, we'll make your business a success!</p>
				</li>
		    <!--Each <LI> will be a block level element that initially displays the first <p>, but upon mouseover, the second <p> will replace the first. These will be short stories to describe the types of customers we will be targeting.  Each of the following <LI>'s will work the same way. -->
				<li>
				    <button>Self-Employed Contractor</button>
				    <p>You are in business for yourself! Everyone's dream, right? Unfortunately, that dream comes along with a lot of headaches, some expected, some not. You are a professional at what you do, but there is so much more that gets in the way of the work. Perhaps you are spending all your time finding new clients, or maybe you are spending any remaining free time getting a handle on your finances. We can solve your problems and get you back to what you do best!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				    <button>"Young" Entrepreneur</button>
				    <p>Congratulations! You have survived the first year of business, or the first two, or three. Although you may not be "Young", your business sure is. You might have something that has taken off, you might be treading water, or you might still be lucky to keep the lights on. Regardless of your current level of (or lack of) success, there is more to achieve. We will work with you to make your business run the way you want it to, whether you are happy with a small company or you have grand ideas of expansion. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				    <button>Established Success</button>
				    <p>Your business has proven itself over multiple years. You have a steady client base, steady income, and most importantly, you are able to sleep well at night! Your business is a success and you are writing your own ticket. You've perfected your processes and can do things faster and more efficiently than ever. So what now? Unfortunately, as even the largest businesses know, if you are not growing and innovating, you risk losing everything. With countless new businesses starting every day, competitors are constantly looking for ways of taking your hard earned clients from you. Our goal is to keep you ahead of the game, ensuring you continue to stand out no matter what your marketplace.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				    <button>Struggling</button>
				    <p>Your business has not been doing as well as you would like. Maybe you had some success when you first started, but it seems like you are always behind. You might have an idea on how to turn it around or you might not. We can help you figure out what is wrong, come up with a plan to turn it around, and execute, adjusting the plan as necessary. Together, we can turn it around, and take your business to the next level. </p>
				</li>
				<li>
				    <button>Tried and True</button>
				    <p>You have a company that has been around for years, you have been doing things a certain way for as long as you can remember, and you have been more or less content with your results. If there is one constant in the world, it is change. Unfortunately, you have to always be ready for the next market change. Maybe a large chain has moved into the area, maybe people are just not as interested in your product as they used to be, maybe your client base is shrinking due to an aging group of regulars. We will brace you for change, help you increase your client base, and ultimately increase your profits.</p>

		    <div id="partner" class="pretext">
			<p>Shoestring Sales is not just a company that is going to help you sell your products and services. We will be a partner for your business that you can count on.  We will understand your business and what you are going through.  We will offer suggestions and we will have "skin in the game".  What do we mean by that?</p>
			<p><a href="#pricing">See the pricing section</a> to find out how we make an initial investment into your business. We want to see you succeed and we will do what it takes to get you there, as any good partner would. But some would say that having a partner is a bad thing. Of course if you've ever gone into business with anyone, there are downsides. But thankfully, with our unique processes, Shoestring Sales will mitigate those negatives and amplify the positives.  Here's how:</p>
			<div class="dropdown">
			    <ul id="partnerstrengths" class="secondlevel">
				<li>
				    <h5>Two Heads are Better than One</h5>
				    <p>You know your craft. We freely acknowledge that. You also probably have a good head for business, you did start your own after all. Our goal is not to tell you what you should be doing, but rather to collaborate, combine knowledge and work together to further your business. We want to help you more efficiently do what you are already doing and more effectively sell your products and services. By channelling your knowledge and skills, you will be able to do more with less.
				</li>
				<li>
				    <h5>Specialization</h5>
				    <p>Although you have the ability to do it yourself, we will take over the marketing and promotion of your business, we will keep an eye on your finances, and we will manage ongoing communication with your clients. Depending upon the situation, we can take on the tasks that you just don't like doing. We'll create systems that make those undesirable activities much simpler. You will still be intimately involved in the whole process, but we will free you up to concentrate on the meat and potatoes of your business.</p> 
				</li>
				<li>
				    <h5>Our Investment</h5>
				    <p>Not only will be provide our outstanding services to you, we will also make a significant investment into your business. <a href="#pricing">See our pricing section for more specific information.</a> Unlike most companies who offer products and services to you, we will not ask for full payment upon completion. Instead, we will defer a significant portion of those costs, banking on our ability to make your business a success. If you don't succeed, we don't succeed.</p>

		    <div id="process" class="pretext">
			<p>When you sign up with Shoestring Sales, you will immediately begin our process which will get you to the next stage of success in your business</p>  
			<div class="dropdown">
			    <ul>
				<li>
				    <p>Pre-Work: Information Gathering</p>
				    <p>Immediately after signing up with us, we will start learning about your business. In order to do that, we'll walk you through what we need from you before our first meeting. After a brief questionnaire, you'll be able to send us necessary documents. In addition, we'll give you some questions to really think about before our first meeting. Everything you provide us will help us better guide your business to success.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				    <p>Step 1: Initial Meeting</p>
				    <p>Within a week of providing us information about your company, we will meet (in person or via Skype) to discuss the scope of our partnership. We will use your information to zero in on your Unique Sales Proposition, and use that to guide the process. In this meeting we will lay the groundwork for your new website design, ensure you understand the services we provide, and agree on terms of our partnership.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				    <p>Step 2: First Planning Meeting</p>
				    <p>By the end of the first month, we will meet again to complete the first planning phase. Based on conversation in the initial meeting, the marketing plan will be ready for you to review, uploaded to your business dashboard, with the ability to make changes. In addition, we'll provide wire-frame samples of your new website for you to review and make changes if necessary. Finally, we'll work on putting some initial strategies into place based off of the marketing plan.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				    <p>Step 3: Second Planning Meeting</p>
				    <p>By the end of the second month with Shoestring Sales, you will really start to see the change. Your website will be full of content and styled.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				    <p>Step 4: Go Live</p>
				    <p>Depending upon the depth of your website, our Go Live date will vary.  Thankfully, we will be able to let you know early on what that timeframe will look like.</p>
